This project is for me to get familiar with Python and Object Oriented Programming in general. I hope you enjoy!

Instructions to play:

1. Install requirements listed in txt, either individually with "pip install (package name)" or as all at once with "pip install -r requirements.txt" while in the pysnake directory.

2. Run `start_app.py` with `python start_app.py` while in the `pysnake` directory.

Note: This is a work in progress, many core game elements may not be implemented yet.

# Introduction

## About

The **BEST** python snake with fun gameplay, custom map creation, and maybe soon to be dungeon crawling!

## Instructions to play 

### Installation

1. Clone this project and enter the `Snakefest\` directory.  

2. Install requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
    * Creating a virtual environment at this stage is optional.  

3. Run `python start_app.py`.

### Gameplay

Snakefest's gameplay is like any other snake game. Use the `WASD` keys to move around and get the apples to grow as long as you can.

### Map Creator

Snakefest comes with 2 simple maps with 3 sizes of each. In addition, you can make your own maps in the map creator! In the future, maps in the game will probably include mazes, multi-room dungeons, cookies, and other really weird shapes. Play around with the map creator, since that is the main feature of the game so far!  

Limits on maps as of 08-26:  
* 1 <= rows <= 20
* 1 <= columns <= 35

## TODO

* Add ice tiles which you can't turn on
* Snake skins, hats, aesthetics
* Add highscore
* Map creator preview
* Limits for map creator fields
* Deleting and editing maps

This project is for me to get familiar with Python and Object Oriented Programming in general. I hope you enjoy!

Instructions to play:

1. Install requirements listed in txt, either individually with "pip3 install (package name)" or as all at once with "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" while in the pysnake directory.

2. While in the pysnake directory, run "python3 -m snake" to run the game.

3. Have fun!

Note: This is a work in progress, many core game elements may not be implemented yet.
